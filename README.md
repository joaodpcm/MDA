# Modern Data Analytics 

## Netherlands - 2023

The project aimed to: 

To create an app able to predict noise levels in Naamsestraat, Leuven (Belgium).  


For doing so, several specific stages were accomplished: 

1. Collecting data 
2. Preprocessing data
3. Modelling: data analysis 
4. Performing predictions on realtime data
5. Developing the app 
6. Putting the app into good use the model thourgh the app


For having access to the app, please clik [here](https://joaodpcm-mda-app-arfcvd.streamlit.app). The code related to its development can be found [here](App.py)

Two models were trained for doing predictions about the noise levels: a classifier and a regressor. You can access the code of the model training for the classifier [here](classifier_model_training.ipynb). The model training for the regressor is located [here](regressor_model_training.ipynb). 

The regressor model was used for the app and it is stored [here](regressor.pkl). 

The requirements text file can be found [here](requirements.txt) If you want to explore the used final data set, please find it [here](data.csv).
