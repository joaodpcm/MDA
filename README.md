# Modern Data Analytics 

## Netherlands - 2023

The project aimed to: 

To create an app able to predict noise levels in Naamsestraat, Leuven (Belgium).  


For doing so, several specific stages were accomplished: 

1. Collecting data 
2. Preprocessing data
3. Modelling: data analysis 
4. Performing predictions on realtime data
5. Developing the app 
6. Putting the app into good use the model thourgh the app


For having access to the app, please clik [here](https://joaodpcm-mda-app-arfcvd.streamlit.app). The code related to its development can be found [here](App.py)

For accessing to the model training for the [classifier](classifier_model_training.ipynb). For the regressor you can click [here](regressor_model_training.ipynb). The regressor model was used for the app and it is stored [here](regressor.pkl).
